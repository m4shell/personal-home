      <description>Financial freedom isn’t X amount. Luxuries soon become necessities, X constantly grows. In a world where everyone is triggering you to borrow &amp;amp; buy what you don’t need, being content &amp;amp; debt-free is true financial freedom. Common sense stuff, rarely said.</description>

      <description>It was in 2016 when Vasanth, Anugrah, and Rohan pitched smallcase. We were quickly sold on their idea of getting users to invest in diversified baskets of stocks or ideas they understood vs single stocks, which reduced their risk.
We had just opened up Kite APIs. The idea was to enable startups to build platforms that could grow the shallow Indian capital market ecosystem.
Today, they&amp;rsquo;ve built an amazing ecosystem of products.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve stopped giving random gifts. Only been gifting stocks &amp;amp; ETFs for a while now. Don&amp;rsquo;t have to waste hours choosing the right gift and the best bit: several of my family &amp;amp; friends have started investing because of this.
The only challenge now is with convincing the wife that Sovereign Gold bonds is the best form of gold on her birthday.</description>

      <description>How will the broking industry perform next few years? This is a question I get asked often, more recently. I usually say, if you can tell me the Nifty direction or volatility, I can tell you what the broking industry will do. Because both are positively correlated.
User growth depends on whether the markets (Nifty) go up or not. It took &amp;gt;10 years to reach the high made in 2008 in terms of new user addition (total NSDL + CDSL Demat).</description>

      <description>The last 18 months at Zerodha have been eventful, to say the least. Historically, market crashes caused panic &amp;amp; reduced activity. But this crisis led to a rush of new customers looking to buy into stocks on sale. Free time due to lockdowns &amp;amp; low bank deposit rates helped.
Once this younger bunch of first-time investors saw quick profits, they started spreading the word and got their friends &amp;amp; family to invest.</description>

      <title>The risk for high growth B2C tech IPOs</title>
      <link>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/high-growth-tech-ipos/</link>

      <guid>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/high-growth-tech-ipos/</guid>
      <description>The risk with all the high growth B2C tech IPOs coming up is growth plateauing. Growth is usually a function of agility &amp;amp; product bets. Since these companies take more bets &amp;amp; are more agile &amp;amp; aggressive than traditional businesses, they grow faster (Zerodha as well).
The question then, will the ability of these companies to be agile (reason for growth) reduce because of all the scrutiny that comes by being publicly listed?</description>

      <title>Why look at notional contract value when buying options?</title>

      <description>Why look at notional contract value when buying options?
Yes, when you buy options the max you can lose is the premium you have paid. But to get a sense of risk and how fast or easily you can lose, you should look at the exposure or contract value, not the premium.
For eg, you have Rs 1L &amp;amp; you use it to buy 20 lots of Nifty calls = Rs 1.</description>

      <description>What most traders don&amp;rsquo;t realize is that they pay a good chunk of their capital as costs. If you add impact costs, the minimum return an active trader should generate to break even yearly on their portfolio is usually well above 20%. Yep, that high and that tough.
Costs include Statutory costs like STT, Stamp duty, GST Impact costs or slippages (while this doesn’t even seem like a cost, it adds up quickly.</description>

      <description>When you&amp;rsquo;re in a drawdown while trading, the best thing to do is to take a break. Otherwise, the chances of you being irrational, taking large bets, overtrading &amp;amp; blowing up are high. And to nudge you to do just that, we now have a “Kill Switch”.
Enabling the Kill switch will instantly disable trading. Currently, this is manual. But we are working on automating this where you can set a maximum loss.</description>

      <description>We are stoked about the new tagging feature on Console. Tagging your trades and maintaining a trading journal can help you become a better trader and also help you track your investment goals.
You can&amp;rsquo;t become a better trader if you don&amp;rsquo;t learn from your mistakes. But in order to learn, you need a proper journal of all your trades and the reasons you took the trades. You can then look back, review, and do more of what is working &amp;amp; less of what isn&amp;rsquo;t.</description>

      <description>I’m surprised by the unwanted noise around this whole salary news of Nikhil, Seema (my wife), &amp;amp; me. The headlines are misleading. We are a private company &amp;amp; no obligations to clarify, but we thought maybe we should, as there are folks who are misinterpreting this.
Firstly the reported figure isn’t the actual salary being drawn. This is an enabling resolution that allows us as working promoters to draw salaries up to the number in case of liquidity requirements.</description>

Why haven’t we raised any external capital, especially at times like these when we could get some crazy valuation? I had talked about it earlier</description>

      <title>The biggest wealth destroyer when investing</title>

      <guid>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/biggest-wealth-destroyer-when-investing/</guid>
      <description>What is the biggest wealth destroyer when investing?
Averaging down or buying more of an asset, be it stock or crypto, as the price keeps going down and hoping that the price bounces to recover losses or make profits faster. Common behaviour among retail investors.
While it is tempting to average down, the odds of this strategy working are significantly low in the long run. All it takes is one large move on the other side for things to go wrong.</description>

      <title>The risk of offering high leverages</title>
      <link>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/risk-of-offering-high-leverages/</link>

      <guid>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/risk-of-offering-high-leverages/</guid>
      <description>When a platform offers leverage or funds the customer to buy for more than the money in the account, the platform takes a credit risk. With Crypto exchanges offering 10 to 100x leverage (futures), on days like today, I wonder who monitors liquidity position of these platforms.
In regulated space, even with all checks &amp;amp; balances, brokerage firms once in a while on days of extreme volatility go bust. If exchange offers 50x leverage &amp;amp; say Bitcoin goes down 4% in one tick, a customer with $1K, can lose $2K.</description>

      <description>At Zerodha, we have just killed all work-related chats post 6 pm &amp;amp; holidays. Also trying to get as many conversations to be asynchronous, moving them from chat to our internal instance of Discourse. Curious to see if this helps reduce the feeling of burnt out &amp;amp; brain fried. Apparently, multitasking hurts performance and may even damage the brain (check the link below). Being part of multiple discussions on different topics in different chat groups simultaneously (Multitasking) has gone up exponentially post WFH.</description>

      <description>While we all work together to figure out what we can do to help in the current situation, I think the only long-term fix is for as many of us to move away from large cities. This is the answer to many of India’s problems. And now is probably the right time to work towards it.
Large cities are choking &amp;amp; will continue to break down every time we&amp;rsquo;re tested, COVID today, could be water shortages, pollution, floods, etc.</description>

Why Free &amp;amp; Open source software?
 Superior utility: Pretty much everything in the known universe uses FOSS, from the Mars rovers to our phones to washing machines.</description>

      <guid>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/why-doesnt-zerodha-advertise/</guid>
      <description>One thing I get asked the most and I’ve tweeted about this numerous times is that why don’t we advertise. Firstly I&amp;rsquo;d shared this sometime back.
Unlike buying a mobile phone or ordering a pizza, you don&amp;rsquo;t invest in stocks &amp;amp; MFs impulsively. Most often than not, we invest because of greed or because of our friends. And regulations don&amp;rsquo;t allow you to advertise greed.
Ads do help you create visibility and build credibility - two really important things in the business of money, especially the first few years.</description>

This was the reason behind partnering with LearnApp through Rainmatter. The amazing bit in the journey has been that some of the best folks in our industry have been incredibly generous with their time to share their knowledge with no expectations.</description>

      <description>Right now, is probably the stupidest time for fintech firms like @zerodhaonline to be raising money. It is quite crazy the number of folks reaching out &amp;amp; the different deals. We might regret it in the future, but we are not raising &amp;amp; here are the counterintuitive reasons why.
We don’t need the money, so there’s no point in raising money just because someone is ready to give it to you.</description>

      <description>The big news from last week was the blow-up of a leveraged hedge fund Archegos &amp;amp; how it caused $billions in losses to its bank/broker. A primer to what it means to be a brokerage for such trades, the risk to reward, and more.
Being a broker is almost like running an insurance business, you keep earning brokerage income (like premium) &amp;amp; are always one black swan or mega volatile day away from giving it all back and more if one large client or many small clients default at the same time.</description>

      <description>This is a more systemic issue, not with one bank but across the board, banks to ed-tech to fintech. As long as you give revenue targets &amp;amp; push employees to get there, products that generate more revenue for the business over what is right for the customer will be mis-sold.
Easier for employees of banks, brokerages, wealth management firms to mis-sell as relationships are already established &amp;amp; there is trust with the brand, which is why the customer has allowed them to be custodians of their assets.</description>

      <description>Got a few questions about this tweet. How to know when odds are higher? The decision to trade should have multiple checkboxes, can’t just be one. Size has to be based on how many checkboxes a bet ticks. And this rule I think holds good not just for trading, but investing, business, &amp;amp; life. Let me explain.
Say your strategy is to buy or sell a stock every time price crosses a Moving Avg.</description>

Super lucky to have parents who stood by through all my stupidity regardless of what people told them, that&amp;rsquo;s how I survived. Until Zerodha, I was always told to go get a real job.</description>

      <description>Many retail investors buy Rights Entitlements (REs) without knowing that the value of REs will be zero if they don&amp;rsquo;t apply. Since May 2020 our clients have lost ~Rs 10cr by buying Rights entitlements &amp;amp; not applying. We now have a nudge to warn customers. Read about it here.</description>

      <title>My view on reduction of intraday leverages</title>
      <link>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/my-view-on-reduction-of-intraday-leverages/</link>

      <guid>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/my-view-on-reduction-of-intraday-leverages/</guid>
      <description>My view on the reduction of intraday leverages is that there will be near-term pain (for Zerodha too). We&amp;rsquo;ll see a drop in trading volumes and an increase in impact cost. But in the long term, more traders will survive &amp;amp; hopefully make up for the dip.
There is an argument to be made for lesser intraday margins. VAR+ELM or SPAN+Exposure margin calculation is based on risk/volatility. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t differentiate between intraday &amp;amp; overnight risk, or that intraday is less risky and hence ideally requires lesser margins.</description>

      <description>Consider the yearly demat addition for the last 20yrs. Stockbroking is as high beta as it can get. When someone asks for my view on the future, I usually ask them for their view on Nifty. The last boom &amp;amp; bust was in 2007-08, took 10 yrs to get back to those numbers. A high beta business is one that has a higher sensitivity to the market (Nifty). If Nifty does well, business outperforms the market by a fair bit, and if Nifty doesn&amp;rsquo;t, it underperforms the market by a fair bit.</description>

      <description>How big was Jan 2021 for the broking industry? The best year for the markets since 2010 was by far 2014. Nifty was up more than 30% and the industry added 13 lakh new Demat accounts in 1 year. And, Jan 2021, just in 1 month 17 lakh new Demat accounts were added. Water buffaloGrimacing face</description>

      <description>In the Gamestop saga, the media has loved telling the story of how Retail made a lot of money from Hedge funds. The reality is entirely different, almost everyone apart from retail has probably made money or benefited from this.
Firstly, yes, a couple of Hedge funds were sitting on large losses on Gamestop shorts. Now that stock is at $50, the losses also would be a fraction, if the shorts still held.</description>

      <description>Financial awareness about the importance of saving and investing in India is increasing at the fastest rate ever, especially among millennials. Of course, stock markets doing well and lower bank FD rates are helping. But there are also a few structural changes afoot here. Historically financial products have been sold hard &amp;amp; mostly in person. Products mostly sold based on promises of high returns (sales pitches in person leave no audit trail).</description>

      <description>Looking at trading turnover to estimate capital market size is misleading. Most trades are leveraged &amp;amp; ideally we should look at the margins being traded, not the trade value. Turnover this way will be less than 10% of the trading turnover declared.
The best way to estimate the size of the Indian capital markets is by checking the revenue pool. This I think, is less than Rs 50k crores across 1500+ brokers, exchanges, &amp;amp; depositories.</description>

      <description>Since broking is hot post-COVID, inspite of all the spike in trading volumes and activtity, the total addressable market is just ~1.5 million users. I had shared this pre-Covid. Broking is super hot now, but this TAM (Total addressable market) hasn&amp;rsquo;t changed, if anything it has reduced. Btw, the revenue-generating active day traders + F&amp;amp;O crowd is not more than ~1.5mil in spite of the spike in trading activity/volumes. This active crowd is unlikely to go up because most day and F&amp;amp;O traders stop within 6 months.</description>

      <description>https://freakonomics.com/podcast/advertising-part-2/ This is a great listen from Freakonomics on whether advertising works. The reason we could bootstrap was that we never spent on ads. With no ads, a business is forced to constantly think &amp;amp; do things to get customer love and organic growth. The only time we experimented with ads was for our brand keyword, show our website if you search &amp;ldquo;Zerodha&amp;rdquo;. We stopped immediately when we realized that it made no difference to the traffic and the ad was essentially cannibalizing our organic traffic while costing us money.</description>

      <description>A question I have been asking institutional investors in both private and public markets is - if they could enter and exit their holdings at will like retail investors(which they cannot today), would they have actually sat through the ride of their best-performing holdings? The answer usually is no. As counterintuitive as it sounds, maybe the inability to easily enter/exit large public or illiquid private holdings forces fund managers to sit tight, which is also why they can outperform retail investors who are always trying to time the market.</description>

      <description>https://zenx.medium.com/the-six-dots-problem-re-imagining-india-b7d81b223827 The flip side of tech-first businesses like ours is that we don&amp;rsquo;t create as many jobs. We are around the same number of employees today at 3.8mn clients as we were when we had 1mn clients. As @kunalb11 says, inefficiency is the biggest employer in the world. A way to solve this employment problem is to enable jobs(economy) not just in the top 6 cities, but maybe 600 towns/villages. The only +ve this year has been that maybe some it is happening.</description>

      <description>https://tradingqna.com/t/personal-lessons-from-20-years-of-trading-broking-working/94600
Almost unreal that we could represent Zerodha on the cover of Forbes. Some personal lessons from the many highs &amp;amp; many lows in this 20-year journey working, trading, trying to build different types of businesses, &amp;amp; more.
Businesses can be built in multiple ways. Don&amp;rsquo;t try to cut-copy-paste what others are doing - it mostly won’t work. Do what feels right to you. Your instincts on what is right will work better when you build a business/career around what you love.</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;The real hockey curve growth we all need to be chasing - seeds (maybe not companies)&amp;quot;. @zenx said while handing over these 50 odd seeds. Seeds that can turn into trees, and in turn result in many more seeds and trees, providing for food and helping the planet for 100&amp;rsquo;s of years.</description>

      <title>Does technical analysis work?</title>

      <guid>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/does-technical-analysis-work/</guid>
      <description>Am often asked if Technical Analysis actually works. Firstly, there&amp;rsquo;s nothing that just &amp;ldquo;works&amp;rdquo; in trading. But TA works well for retail as it doesn&amp;rsquo;t let you trade against the trend &amp;amp; defines stoploss every trade - main reasons for retail traders&amp;rsquo; losses.</description>

      <title>The best way of investing in gold</title>
      <link>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/the-best-way-of-investing-in-gold/</link>

      <description>https://tradingqna.com/t/whats-the-best-option-to-invest-in-gold/93314 Seems like everyone is selling digital gold. On digital gold, you lose 3% as GST, upto 2% in commissions, &amp;amp; a spread &amp;gt;5% (buy-sell difference). If you are looking at gold as an investment, Sovereign gold bonds followed by Gold ETF/MFs are the best option.</description>

      <title>Sitting on a profitable trade is harder than sitting on a loss making trade</title>

      <guid>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/sitting-on-a-profitable-trade-is-harder-than-on-a/</guid>
      <description>Contrary to what most people think, it is much tougher to sit on a profitable trade vs loss-making. All decent traders have a defined stop to handle losing trades. When on profit, we all know we have to let our winners run, but all our biases constantly push us to book profits.</description>

      <description>#Scam1992TheHarshadMehtaStory - a thread on everything that has changed since then in the world of Indian stockbroking.
Today the settlement cycle is 2 days &amp;amp; SEBI is hinting at a 1-day cycle soon (first few countries in the world). Back then, it was 14 days (the time within which you have to pay full money and take delivery of stocks or deliver stocks if sold).
Today, a customer can’t buy stocks without the minimum money in the account or sell without stocks in Demat.</description>

      <title>Generalists vs specialists</title>

      <description>My view on Generalist vs Specialist? Being a jack of all trades helps you grow intellectually &amp;amp; increases odds of finding what you love. But as a business, I think going after one problem(What u love &amp;amp; Core competency) has a much higher chance of success than to spray &amp;amp; hope.</description>

This article explains why beautifully - &amp;ldquo;We have more time for leisure than we did fifty years ago. But leisure has never been less relaxing&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <title>Has there been a surge in investors from tier 2 and 3 cities?</title>

      <description>The reason for the noise around markets growing in tier 2/3 cities is because everyone tracks users based on address proof. Lot of people migrate from small towns to cities for jobs but address proof remains the same, hence misleading. By IP address for us: 75% from top 20 cities. Everyone = Financial services firms Map= Google analytics</description>

      <description>Thanks for the love @rajeshsawhney , our edge as a business is the agility, it helps us compete against those with deep pockets. IPO invariably will mean losing some of that agility. I don&amp;rsquo;t know if we&amp;rsquo;d want to IPO especially in times like now when everyone seems deep pockets.Grimacing face</description>
