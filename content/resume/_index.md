# title: "First Last"

I am a software developer. I read, write code as a hobby. I am fortunate enough to make a living out of it as well.

I discovered programming in 2006, right after getting a personal computer. Starting with Java the Object Oriented 
style attracted me initially to programming. That soon transferred to C++ and I often get overwhelmed by its complexity.
These days I mostly write programs in Go, Python

My professional experience range across multiple domains like automotive infotainment, energy management, network function virtualization and cybersecurity. I started my career hacking embeded systems and gradually transitioned to distributed systems which was something I always wanted to work on. 

Somewhere in my early twenties I developed preferences for certain aesthetics and adopted highly opinionated paradigms for my daily tasks. I used to maintain a [blog](https://linuxdrug.wordpress.com/) when I explored the world of open source through Linux.
