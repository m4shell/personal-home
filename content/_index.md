
I believe in making the world an easier place to live. Every day I am overwhelmed by the power of code and how it lets humans collaborate

I discovered programming at sixteen, right after getting a personal computer. Soon I realized the only subject that interests me in academia is computer science. Ever since I have used my honest expression of code to build software that is easy to use.

My professional experience range across multiple domains like automotive infotainment, network function virtualization cybersecurity. I started my career hacking embedded systems and gradually transitioned to distributed systems.

Sometimes I bang my head against a [leetcode](https://leetcode.com/mba4cob/) problem. I used to maintain a [blog](https://linuxdrug.wordpress.com/) while exploring the world of open source through Linux.

I am a software developer. I read, write code as a hobby. I am fortunate enough to make a living out of it as well.
